    <p class = "keyeventsp">
        As we all know every city has a history to it, whther it be bad like Salem Massachusets, or as good as the Big Apple, Williamsport had its fair share of history with buisness
        families, and newer oppurtunities along the way, here are some major key events that has happened in Williamsport:

        Two men were responsible for founding Williamsport and their names were Michael Ross, and William Hepburn. Michael Ross is anative to Pennsylvania and lived in what we call Philidelphia, he then becam an indentured servnat to Samuel
        Wallis also known at the time of the Land King of the West Branch of the Susquehanna Valley. As michael started to Work under Samuel he started to earn some land and was able to start fending and living for himself.
        William Hepburn was actually an immigrant from Ireland, and has since then worked up in the thirteen colonies, to the sunbury area (about an hour and fourty five from Williamsport) and then eventually
        moved into Valley to where he purchased land and thus the two combineded lands and made Williamsport.

        The next big event that happeed was the Susquehanna Boom here a system of cribs (little man made islands) were made to help support the logging buisness when the Boom was invented in the susquehanna river. A Boom
        for the logging buisness is a barrier composed of floating logs enclosing other free flowing logs. Around this time (1861-1891) the lumber buisness was booming, as in the city of williamsport and surronding it, there were 3 milling companies that combined all together
        produced up to 5,500,000,000 board feet of lumber, and with this WIlliamsport became one of the most prosperous cities with multiple Millionarires.

        One distruction that happened in Williamsport is the Fire of 1871, in a stable wihch is very close to down town somehow caught on fire, and with how hard the winds were blowing from the south it started to cause the Fire
        to spread alot more than people had thought. the fire itself had caused more than $300,000 worth of damage to the city, and with that hit alot of buildings that brought in their revenue, and old milling company, a millnery, a train station,
        the first courthouse, and one of their churches. To this day there has been no answer to who or how the fire has started that night
