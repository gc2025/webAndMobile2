    <p class = "keyeventsp">
        As we all know every city has a history to it, whether it be bad like Salem Massachusetts, or as good as the Big Apple, Williamsport had its fair share of history with business
        families, and newer opportunities along the way, here are some major key events that has happened in Williamsport:

        Two men were responsible for founding Williamsport and their names were Michael Ross, and William Hepburn. Michael Ross is a native to Pennsylvania and lived in what we call Philadelphia, he then became an indentured servant to Samuel
        Wallis is also known as the time of the Land King of the West Branch of the Susquehanna Valley. As Michael started to Work under Samuel, he started to earn some land and was able to start fending and living for himself.
        William Hepburn was actually an immigrant from Ireland, and has since then worked up in the thirteen colonies, to the Sunbury area (about an hour and forty-five from Williamsport) and then eventually
        moved into the Valley to where he purchased land and thus the two combined lands and made Williamsport

        The next big event that happened was the Susquehanna Boom here a system of cribs (little man-made islands) was made to help support the logging business when the Boom was invented in the Susquehanna River. A Big Boom
        for the logging business is a barrier composed of floating logs enclosing other free flowing logs. Around this time (1861-1891) the lumber business was booming, as in the city of Williamsport and surrounding it, there were 3 milling companies that combined all together
        produced up to 5,500,000,000 board feet of lumber, and with this Williamsport became one of the most prosperous cities with multiple Millionaires.

        One destruction that happened in Williamsport is the Fire of 1871, in a stable which is very close to downtown somehow caught on fire, and with how hard the winds were blowing from the south it started to cause the Fire
        to spread a lot more than people had thought. the fire itself had caused more than $300,000 worth of damage to the city, and with that hit a lot of buildings that brought in their revenue, and old milling company, a millinery, a train station,
        the first courthouse, and one of their churches. To this day there has been no answer to who or how the fire started that night.
