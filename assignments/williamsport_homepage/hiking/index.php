            This trail is one of the many trails that they own and they say to be the easiest out of them all, this trail's shape is a loop, and takes
            about 52 mins if you go at a slow and walkable pace. While you hike thos trail you can see multiple informational signs that show different
            foundations or plots of land that were used by multiple things and made a little "Town". The most recent addition to these trails were
            the informational signs, made by Chris Decker, and updated by Gabriel Carson, and the WMWA for their Eagle Scout Project.

        The Raccoon Mountain Trail is also located in the same area owned by the Williamsport Municipal Water Authority, which is near/where the Blue Bird Trail. This trail is also a loop like path
        but also has a higher altittude compared to the Blue Bird Trail, which makes it moderately difficult even though it may be shorter. This trail also houses some History
        that you can also see on the Blue Bird Trail twoards the end of it. At a part of the trail you are actually able to look off of a vista, which helps overlook the valley, and with this trail
        it is very well maintained and has beautiful greenery and animals that you can see.

    <h2 class = "hikingh2">Smiths Knob Trail- Loyalsock State forest</h2>
    <h3 class = "hikingh3">Difficulty: Hard, Length: 4.8, Rating: 4.6/5</h3>
    <div class="hikingPhoto">
        <img src="assets/pictures/smiths_knob.png" alt="Smith Knob Vista">
    
    </div>

    <p class="smithK">
        The Smith Knob trail is located in the Loyalsock State Park which is a local park about an hour away from Williamsport. This trail is considered a difficult trail because of how much of 
        elevation gain there is compared to the other trails in this list, even though the trail is only 4.8 miles, it is said that you could finish it in around 2 hours or more.
        When it comes to this trail no matter what time it is when going on it you can get beautiful views especially with the sunset and sunrise, where you overlook a valley. Since it is a state trail
        these paths are kept pretty nice but due to it being apart of the Appalacian Trail its is only one part of many trails.
