        5/5- "Service good; nice atmosphere. It was good to come there again. Black bean burger very good. Burger with gorgonzola delicious. Chicken enchilada soup delicious. French onion soup not the best."- Sharon H.

    <h1>Boom City Brewery</h1>
    <h2>Rating: 4/5</h2>
    <p class = "lRp">
        The Boom City Brewery and Bar specialize in American Pub and Grill as well as wood oven pizza. the reason they are very different from Bullfrog or anyone else is that they started their buisness off brewing out of their own house, and then decided to invest in a resturant
        to start selling their own IPAs in their own resturant
        <br>  
        Here are a couple of reviews of the resturant:
        <br>
        <br>
        4/5- "Traveling through town and found Boom City for Sunday late dinner. Very happy with food and beer. I had gnocchi. Oh so good. My wife had rigatoni, just as good. Meatballs large. Tender and flavorful. I had log jam. Not as hoppy as I hoped. Loved the benches at the booths. Large menu, options for everyone. Excellent service."- 546MP
