    The Little League Museum houses a lot of history from Williamsport over the years, especially youth baseball. Little League baseball is a yearly event in Williamsport that brings everyone from around
    the world and brings them to the little city.

    Little League began and was founded back in 1947 by a man named Carl E. Stotz who actually used to be a clerk for an oil company, but once he started his program it took him a couple of years
    before it was starting to take off and 48 states participated as well as other places such as Panama, Canada, and Hawaii in 1950 which means it only took him about 3 years to get the program running and moving
    literally and figuratively.

    At the museum you can see how the museum has progressed over the years with expansion, new events, and even inductions to adding new leagues. But of course, COVID-19 had to stop a year of Little League
    and the Museum as well, but since then they have adjusted to everything and are making sure that kids around the world are still involved and are playing.

    One part of their exhibit is located in Downtown Williamsport and is called Bases Loaded, these sculptures were designed and actually made by local Highschool students of the Williamsport
    Area, and are still standing to this day, some statues feature bigger named people such as Cy Young, Jackie Robinson, and President George W. Bush, and little kids running around the bases.
