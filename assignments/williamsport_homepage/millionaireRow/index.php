        First Baptist Church
        <br>
        This church was built in the mid 1860s, this church was constructed with mountain stone which is different from some of the houses that were made, but this showed off a different architecture type of a Romanesque style architecture,
        with some lead glass windows as well

        The Smith-Ulman House
        <br>
        This house was constructed in the mid 1870s, this house was made in a Victorian Second Empire Style house, with a Mansard Roof, arched doors, and even tall windows. One cool thing about this is that teh original carriage house, pretty much an old garage,
        still stands behind it and is now a private clubhouse
