            In 2011 Clyde peeling decided to add a new exhibit where at the time was the biggest and most intresting for its size, which was called
            Dinosaurs come to life. In this exhibit they made real life dinosaur animatronics that were life sized of actual dinosaurs, imagine being underneath
            being under a 30ft. tall T-rex, well here you can.

            Sadly though in 2019, Clyde Peeling passed away after a struggle for 3 years of fighting with a brain tumor that was unoperable and left the buisness to his family.
            But since then and even after COVID-19 hit their buisness, they are still an up and running buisness that still brings in many people to gaze and awe
            at the attractions and animals Clyde Peeling had worked so hard on.
